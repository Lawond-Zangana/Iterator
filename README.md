# CSE 12 Winter 2024 PA4 - Iterators
This code requires the implementation of a generic iterator, MyListIterator, that functions similarly to Javaâ€™s built-in Iterator interface. The assignment involves editing the existing MyLinkedList class to incorporate this new iterator, as well as developing JUnit tests to verify its proper functionality. Students will be tasked with creating specific unit tests that check for correct behavior in various scenarios, including handling edge cases like calling methods at the boundaries of the list. The project emphasizes rigorous testing and accurate implementation to ensure that the iterator behaves correctly with the linked list structure.
